# Predicting-Car-Prices-with-K-Nearest-Neighbors

In this project, I'll be using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict car prices based on their attributes. To do this, I'll be testing multiple models and evaluating their accuracy based on their root mean squared errors. The different models will make use of different features and different values, and the model with the lowest RMSE will be selected.
